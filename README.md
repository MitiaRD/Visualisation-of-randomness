# Visualisation-of-randomness

In this small project the idea was to find a way of visualising randomness to express art through code. Images are displayed through RGB values onto your screen, by randomly assigning 
RGB values through the random.randint library we can create random patterns in a 50*50 pixel frame. This is then displayed to the user with the matplotlib.pyplot library.
